Build the whole solution

To run Anachronox you must perform a data build first.  To do this:
- Create a directory to serve as the intermediate directory
- Create a directory to serve as the compiled data directory

Run RKit_Boot_Win with the following parameters:
-run -build debug -sdir <path to Anachronox "anoxdata" directory> -idir <path to intermediate directory> -ddir <path to compiled data directory> -dsrcdir <path to datasrc directory from this repository>

This will load the RKit build system and build the game data.
