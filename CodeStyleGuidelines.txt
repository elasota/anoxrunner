Hard tabs, width 4.

Unix line breaks (LF only)

Allman indentation style (start braces on line after conditions, same indent as
condition).

Braced blocks of code after a "case" are indented 1 level past the case label.

Code lines consisting of macros, such as RKIT_CHECK, must always be inside braces.
In any other cases, do not use braces for single lines of code.

Starting braces on empty line.

No "auto" except for lambdas or when required.

Do not put headers or prototypes in preprocessor blocks that depend on
RKIT_IS_DEBUG or NDEBUG.
If you absolutely must do something that depends on a debug define, add it to
RKIT_IMPLEMENT_PER_MODULE_FUNCTIONS.

Do not use malloc/free.  Use IMallocDriver.
Do not use new/delete.  Use New/Delete from NewDelete.h.
Do not use new[]/delete[], use vectors.

Private helper functions and templates go in rkit::priv


Nested namespace defs that contain definitions use this syntax:
namespace A { namespace B { namespace C
{
    ...
} // A::B::C


Namespaces must be closed and reopened between declarations and definitions in
header files.  This is so that includes can be inserted between them easily.
