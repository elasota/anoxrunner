Resource jobs have 3 parts:
- CreateIOJob: Creates the job that will load the resource
- RunProcessingTask: Runs any resource processing tasks


Signalled jobs:
All jobs are started when their dependency jobs complete.

Normally, that means that a job must be started by being a dependency of another job.  An alternative is using a "signalled" job which instead creates a "signaller" that can be used to manually complete a placeholder job.  If the signaller is destroyed without being signalled done, then the placeholder job fails instead.
