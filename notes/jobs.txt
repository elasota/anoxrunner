This project uses an async job queue for... almost everything.

To make a job, use an IJobQueue.

CreateJob will accept a JobRunner and a list of dependencies for a job to
create a new job.  The new job will start when all dependencies are done, or
abort if one of them fails.

Sometimes you need to create a job before you know what the dependencies are,
or you need to signal that a job is ready from something that isn't a queued
job.

To do that, call CreateSignaledJob to create a job and a signaler.  To complete
the job, call SignalDone on the signaler with its completion status.  If the
signaler is destroyed before being signaled, then it will automatically signal
completion with the "kJobAborted" status.

Do not call SignalDone on the same signaler more than once.  Doing so will
(usually) trigger an assert in debug builds and have unpredictable results
in release builds.
