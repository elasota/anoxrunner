API equivalencies:

Descriptors:
Sampler: Sampler
Combined image sampler: Sampler-accessible image and sampler (optimal layout only)
Sampled image: Sampler-accessible image
Storage image: Image with load, store, and atomic operations allowed
Uniform texel buffer: Sampler-accessible buffer (1D array of texels)
Storage texel buffer: Buffer with image load, store, and atomic operations allowed
Uniform buffer: Uniforms (constants)
Storage buffer: Storage
Uniform buffer dynamic: Uniforms with a command-specifiable dynamic offset
Storage buffer dynamic: Storage buffer with a command-specifiable dynamic offset
Input attachment: Framebuffer local operation input
Inline uniform block: Constants inlined into descriptor pool memory


D3D12 equivalencies:
Uniform buffer -> Constant buffer view
Storage buffer -> Shader resource view or unordered access view, depending on mutability
Samplers -> Sampler


Mapping of pipeline layouts to D3D12 root signature:
- Push constants -> 32-bit constant root parameters
- Mutable resources -> UAV descriptor
- Read-only resources -> SRV descriptor

Only buffer descriptors and constant buffers may be inlined in D3D12.

Inlined sampler states are in HLSL in D3D12.  In Vulkan they are created with the
descriptor set.





D3D12 SRVs must be specified as one of:
- Buffer, texture (array), potentially multisampled if 2D, acceleration structure

SRVs for textures can remap input components to different input components, 0, or 1

UAV types are the same as SRV type except no acceleration structure


Texture UAVs to snorm/unorm formats must specify as such.



Descriptor layout mappings:
- RWTexture -> Whatever



InputLayout glue behavior:
Data feeds map to input slots.  Slots can have 2 forms:
- Bare form with only the slot name
- Complex form that takes a slot index

The two can not be mixed



VkImage/D3D12 descriptor handling differences

Vulkan:
VkImage
VkImageView
VkFramebuffer


Descriptor and resource type equivalencies:

ConstantBufferView -> Buffer
ShaderResourceView ->
UnorderedAccessView
Sampler
RenderTargetView
DepthStencilView


Vulkan needs a "framebuffer" which is a collection of render targets.


Q2 image import dispositions:
it_skin
it_sprite
it_wall
it_pic
it_sky

pic and sky don't get normal mag filters
sky uses linear filtering
pic normally uses linear filtering, except for conchars
skins are flood-filled
